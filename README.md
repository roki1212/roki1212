# 👋 Hi, I'm roki1212(⬅️ my nickname) – Future Quant Dev in the Making

I'm a young and highly motivated developer, currently too young to work officially —  
but I'm already building real projects, learning daily, and writing code like a pro.

## 🚀 What I do now
- I improve my skills in Python and algorithmic thinking every day, sometimes C++
- I work on real-world inspired personal projects: bots, simulations, visual tools
- I study math, finance, and AI to prepare for a future in quant development

## 💡 Why I'm here
I may not be ready for an official job yet — but I'm here to connect, learn, and grow.  
If you're building something great, I'd love to follow your work or help where I can.
